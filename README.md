# Aperture
A multi-functional Discord bot made in Python!

#### **Note**: This code is a bit unstable since it's one of the first bot when I just started learning discord.py. Therefore, instead of rewriting it, I'm planning to make a whole new one with the discord.py V2.0... Note that this code won't work with V2.0... Still, it runs perfectly and with least bugs with V1.7.3. So you can still use it for learning and practicing stuff ;)

## Requirements:
* Python 3.7 or greater
* discord.py V1.7.3
* A PostgreSQL Server
* Some libraries mentioned in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)

<br>

## Setup:
* Make a Bot Application on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* Make a `.env` file using the [.env.example](./.env.example) Format and fill the required credentials accordingly.
* Set a default prefix for the bot in [botdata.json](./data/botdata.json) file.
* Install the dependencies using `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Run the [launcher.py](./launcher.py) File.

And you are ready to go!

Please Ignore the fact each command is in different file with a separate Cog. This code isn't very good but can just run fine :')

I'll not be very Active on this Project since this code is not very effective anymore and I'm too lazy to make anymore changes in this and rewrite it.

Still if you want to contribute, just make a Pull Request and feel free to open an Issue if you find any Bug or having some issue in the code :)
